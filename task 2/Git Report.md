Report on Git and Github

Git and GitHub are two of the most popular tools used by software developers today. Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.

Git

Git is a tool that lets you keep track of changes to your code over time. It works by giving each user a complete copy of the code on their computer. This makes it easy to work on the same code with other people, even if you're not in the same place.

Git also lets you create different versions of your code at the same time. This is called branching. You can create a new branch to work on a new feature or fix a bug, and then merge your changes back into the main branch when you're finished. This helps to keep your code organised and makes it easy to go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.


GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting app, owned by Microsoft. It provides a number of features that make it easy to collaborate with other developers, such as pull requests, code review, and issue tracking.
To use GitHub, you first need to create an account. Once you have created an account, you can create new repositories or fork existing repositories. Forking a repository creates a copy of the repository on your GitHub account. You can then make changes to the code and submit a pull request to the original repository.
Pull requests allow you to share your changes with the owner of the original repository and request that they be merged into the main branch. GitHub provides a number of features to make it easy to review code and discuss changes with other developers.




Benefits of using Git and GitHub

There are many benefits to using Git and GitHub, including:

Version control: Git allows you to track changes to your code over time and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with other developers on software projects.
Code review: GitHub's pull request feature makes it easy to review code and discuss changes with other developers.
Issue tracking: GitHub's issue tracking feature makes it easy to track and manage bugs and other issues with your code.

Basic Git Workflow 

1. Create or clone a repository
2. Make changes to your code 
3. Stage the changes you want to commit 
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message 
5. Push your changes to a remote repository if you're collaborating with others 
6. Create and merge branches as needed. 

Git and GitHub commands

Here are some of the most common Git and GitHub commands:

git init: Initialises a new Git repository.
git clone: Clones an existing Git repository to your local machine.
git add: Adds files to the staging area.
git commit: Commits the staged changes to the repository.
git push: Pushes the local changes to the remote repository.
git pull: Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
git checkout: Switches to a different branch.
git merge: Merges two branches together.,
git checkout -b: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
git pull request: Creates a pull request to share your changes with the owner of the original repository.

Conclusion

Git and GitHub are essential tools for any software developer. They provide a number of features that make it easy to manage code, collaborate with other developers, and track changes to your code over time.
